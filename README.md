# My Own Version of the Forest App

Hey there,I'm currently working on my very own version of the Forest/Productivity app!

## Features in the App

### 1. **Customizable Time Limits**
First off, I'm giving users the power to set their own time limits for focusing. None of that default stuff here â€“ you get to decide how long you want to concentrate before growing your virtual tree. ðŸ•’ðŸŒ±

### 2. **Personalized Music Selection**
Forget about the generic tunes â€“ in my version, users can groove to their own beats while staying focused. You'll be able to choose your favorite tunes or even upload your own tracks to keep you in the zone. ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ§

### 3. **Auto Lecture Recording**
For all the students out there (myself included!), I'm adding a nifty feature that automatically records lectures while you're focusing. No need to scramble for a pen or hit record â€“ just sit back, relax, and let the app do the work. ðŸŽ¤ðŸ“š

## Why I've made this
I'm not just making a copycat version here â€“ I'm putting my own spin on things on this app, if you have an interest in some other features, drop me a DM and we'll discuss about it!

Stay tuned for updates, gracias! âœ¨
